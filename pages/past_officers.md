We would like to acknowledge all the past PDC officers for the their help and contributions.

#Council Members (2015)

**Chaevia Clendinen** ​ received my Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from Princeton University. While exploring alternative careers, I remain at Princeton as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. I enjoy the outdoors, video games, and spending time with family.

**Denys Bondar** is an Associate Research Scholar at the Department of Chemistry. Denys received his Ph.D. from University of Waterloo, Canada in 2011. He is currently working on developing novel theoretical and computational frameworks for non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. In his free time, Denys likes to do something such that he does nothing.

#Council Members (2013-2014)

**Laura Kraya** <lkraya> (co-chair) [CBE] is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. She received her Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. She arrived in Princeton in the summer of 2011 where she joined the Department of Electrical Engineering. Her research is in the area of surface and interface science, where her work has been focused on understanding the structure and property relationships in both organic and inorganic materials, with an emphasis on ferroelectric materials. She enjoys pilates, hiking, and theater!

**Steph Weber** <scweber> (social) is a Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. She got her PhD in Biochemistry from Stanford, where she studied bacterial chromosome dynamics and polymer physics. Steph arrived at Princeton in Fall 2011 and is currently investigating mechanisms of size control in the nematode C. elegans. She enjoys hiking, running and watching worms grow!

**Becky Sanders** <rlsander> (mailing list) has been a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Geosciences since July, 2011. She received her Ph.D. in Chemistry from the Pennsylvania State University where she used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the reactive surface area of clay minerals. She is currently researching changes to the carbon cycle of permafrost soils as the result of thawing conditions. She loves barre classes, watching football, and playing with her Havanese.

**Pascal Diévart** <pdievart> is an Associate Research Scholar in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) department. He received his PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Lille (France) where he studied the kinetic aspects of diesel fuel combustion. He joined Princeton University in March 2010. He currently investigates experimentally and theoretically the combustion properties of bio-fuels and jet-fuels. He likes baking and the color green.

**Shani Elbaum** <selbaum> (family liaison) is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Chemical and Bioengineering Department at Princeton. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University where she studied mechanisms of tau aggregation implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Shani is currently working on identifying the molecular forces underlying cellular phase transitions associated with RNA/protein granule assembly. These days she enjoys yoga, juicing and biking along the canal.
