## Logistics

### Housing

Typical housing prices in the Princeton area are higher than in many parts of the country and average $900/month for a studio and $1500/month for a two-bedroom. Cheaper apartments with accessible public transportation may be found outside Princeton in neighboring Plainsboro, Princeton Junction, and parts of Lawrenceville and Kingston. Please note that under NJ law, tenants signing a lease are liable for the entire lease period, and should compare prices carefully before signing an agreement. University housing is not generally available for postdoctoral scholars. Postdocs may apply, but are very unlikely to receive housing through the University unless they have a dual appointment as a lecturer. Off campus housing information can be obtained through the [University Off Campus Housing](https://offcampushousing.princeton.edu/index.php) website (use netID or contact Sarah Major (smajor) for access), or through [TigerTrade](http://point.princeton.edu/tigertrade/).
​

### Benefits

When you arrive on campus, one of the first things you'll need to do is visit [Human Resources](http://www.princeton.edu/hr/) in New South.  They will give you a packet of information regarding health care and retirement plans to choose from.

### International Scholars

Postdoctoral scholars coming to Princeton from abroad have several resources available to ease the transition. Visa support is available to incoming Princeton employees through the Office of Visa Services, while more a more general welcome to the US and to Princeton is provided by the Davis International Center.  The staff at Davis can help answer questions regarding visas and transitioning to life in Princeton.  Davis also hosts [Cheers Around the World](World), an opportunity to mix and mingle with international scholars.  American postdocs are welcome at these events if they are accompanied by an international postdoc.



## Professional

### The McGraw Center for Teaching & Learning

The McGraw Center surveys research on human learning to promote best practices in the classroom, and provides pedagogical training to postdoctoral scholars both informally and as part of a Teaching Transcript Program certification.​

### Princeton Career Services


Princeton Career Services provide programming for graduate students which is generally relevant to (and open to) postdocs. Programming is listed on their website, and in particular includes two annual events of interest: the academic job market overview (August) and talking about teaching (December). Moreover, postdocs can sign up for a 1/2 hour individual career counseling session, with sporadic follow-ups if necessary (email Amy Pszczolkowski <apszczol> or call 609-258-3325 to schedule an appointment).  Additionally, Career Services recommends we tap the alumni networks of our undergraduate and graduate institutions. Finally, in addition to your field-dependent (academic and private-sector) research listings, consider tapping the Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Higher Education, HigherEdJobs and Academic 360 job boards for more teaching-oriented academic posts (for which this handbook comes highly recommended).

### The Princeton Writing Program

The program provides resources to help students and postdocs write more effectively.  PWP offers workshops on technical writing, as well as fellowships for postdocs to teach writing seminars for graduate students.  

### Princeton Writes Program

Princeton Writes, which was established in 2013 to strengthen the practical communication skills of our University community, welcomes postdocs who wish to enhance their command of the written and spoken word.  Whether you are drafting a cover letter or other type of correspondence, preparing for an interview or job talk, crafting a personal statement or profile, or wrestling with a question of grammar or punctuation, this program can assist you.  Located in Dillon Court East, between Whitman College and Dillon Gymnasium, Princeton Writesoffers a supportive and confidential learning environment.  To request a one-on-one meeting, please visit their [website](https://pwrites.princeton.edu/tutorials/).  General questions can be addressed to [pwrites@princeton.edu](mailto:pwrites@princeton.edu).

Please note that Princeton Writes does not offer English as a second language instruction or editorial services relating to scholarly materials.

### Course Auditing

Postdocs may audit courses as staff, registering on the first day of availability for $125 (this fee may sometimes be waived). Interested parties should contact the Office of Community and Regional Affairs <pucra>.

### Alternative Careers

Very few resources exist for alternative careers, but those of us in the NYC area can benefit from [Versatile PhD](http://versatilephd.com/) and the [Dropout Club mailing list.](http://www.dropoutclub.org/main/authorization/signIn?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropoutclub.org%2F)


### Fellowship Opportunities
